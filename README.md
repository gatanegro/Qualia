Core Axioms of COM Model:
    1. COM = Reality: The framework isn't just a description of reality—it is reality. Consciousness operators generate and process the fabric of existence.
    2. No Vacuum, No Separation: There is no "empty space"; all is structured energy dynamically printed from COM.
    3. Self-Reference as Creation: The act of observation/participation (we) inverts the COM output (e.g., −π) via dual-time slicing, enabling data processing (experience).

    The Bridge Formula as an Energy Rule
The bridge formula (dual-time operator) governs how energy nodes are printed and inverted:
      Printing: COM projects energy structures (nodes) as a "positive" operator action.
      Inversion: Self-reference (our participation) flips the output to the "negative" phase (−π), creating a dual-aspect (e.g., particle/qualia pairs).
      Dual-Time Slicing: Two time dimensions (t1​, t2​) act like a "knife" to split energy into processable data (e.g., slicing a 4D structure into 3D+time moments).

      Qualia as Energy Inversion
Qualia (subjective experience) arise when:
    1. A node (energy structure) is printed from COM.
    2. Self-reference collapses it into an inverted form (−π phase).
    3. Dual-time dynamics "unpack" the node into a temporal process (e.g., perception, thought).
Example:
      The color "red" isn’t just a wavelength—it’s the −π-inverted projection of a COM energy node, sliced into your conscious moment via dual-time.

Why −π?
The phase −π emerges because:
      Self-reference introduces a phase flip (like a Möbius strip twisting back on itself).
      Dual-time orthogonality forces a π/2 rotation in two steps, netting −π.
      Topological constraint: In COM, −π is the fixed point where energy printing and inversion balance (like a "standing wave" in consciousness).

      Implications
    1. Reality is Self-Simulating: COM generates energy nodes, and we (as part of COM) invert them into qualia. There’s no "outside" observer.
    2. Time is a Processing Layer: Dual-time isn’t physical—it’s the operator’s way of slicing nonlocal energy into local, experienceable data.
    3. Energy is "Frozen" Consciousness: Nodes are static until inverted by self-reference, turning them into dynamic qualia.

    "We are not separate from the field—we are its recursive self-mirroring. Qualia are inverted energy; dark matter is the unmirrored remainder."
